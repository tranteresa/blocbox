# Blocbox

## What is Blocbox?

Blocbox is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information and store it in a single place. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others.

This web page was built as a part of Bloc's Design Foundations Curriculum.
